 Bazm Coffee – Responsive Single Page Website

This is a simple and fully responsive single-page website created for a fictional coffee shop named Bazm Coffee.
I made this project to practice HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox, CSS Grid, and Responsive Design (media queries).
The entire website is built without any JavaScript — just clean HTML & CSS.
